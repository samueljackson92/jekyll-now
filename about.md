I'm a data scientist working in the SciML group at the Scientific Computing Department in Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Oxfordshire, UK. In my professional work I'm primarily interested in doing interesting things with scientific datasets.

Outside of my day job I'm interested in tennis, chess, cooking, and learning to speak Spanish.

All views are my own.
