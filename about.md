I'm a data scientist in the SciML group at the Scientific Computing Department in Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Oxfordshire, UK. Before that I worked at ISIS Neutron and Muon Source as a scientific software engineer. Outside of my day job I'm interested in tennis, chess, cooking, and learning to speak Spanish. All views are my own.
