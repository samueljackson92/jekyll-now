title: Remote Sensing Instruments
---

I'm currently working on a project that involves data collected from the SLSTR
instruments onboard Sentinel-3 satellites. Below are my notes providing a
round-up of current and historical remote sensing platforms and their
corresponding specs. I've listed the sources for where I got the numbers from
for each 

### AATSR
Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) are instruments on board ESA's
ENVISAT satellites. The AASTR instruments were designed for multi-purpose
visual and IR imagery, with emphasis on very accurate sea surface temperature
(SST) for climate monitoring. They have mostly been succeded by the SLSTR
onboard Sentinel-3

#### Key Specs
 - 1km nadir resolution
 - 500km swath width
 - SST accuracy: 0.5K

### AVHRR 
Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) instruments were operated by
the US department of commerce's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
(NOAA). They are also deployed on the ESA's MetOp satellites. The models vary
from the original 4 channel model while the latest model (AVHRR/3) has 6
channels. There primary role is to monitor clouds and thermal emission. The
AVHRR instrument data is particularly useful for monitoring the effects of
climate change due to their long service history.

#### Key Specs
 - 1km nadir resolution
 - 2900km swath width

### SLSTR
Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) is mounted onboard the
Sentinel-3 satellite operated by ESA. Provide Sea and Land Surface Temperature
(SST, LST) data.

### OLI 
Operational Land Imager (OLI) onboard Landsat 8.
